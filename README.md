# 🎉 Event Locator Application

## 📜 Project Description

Develop a multi-user event locator application allowing users to discover events based on location and preferences. The application includes the following features:

---

### 👤 User Management
- **🔒 Secure user registration and login** with password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
- Users can set their **📍 location** and **🎯 preferred event categories**.

---

### 📅 Event Management
- Users (or administrators) can **➕ create**, **📖 read**, **✏️ update**, and **❌ delete** events.
- Event details include **📍 location (latitude/longitude)**, **⏰ date/time**, and **🏷️ categories**.

---

### 🔍 Location-Based Search
- Implement a **🔎 search functionality** that allows users to find events within a specified radius of their location.

---

### 🏷️ Category Filtering
- Enable users to filter events based on **🏷️ categories**.

---

### 🌍 Multilingual Support (i18n)
- Enable users to select their preferred **🌐 language** for the user interface.

---

### 🔔 Notification System (Queuing) _(Optional)_
- Utilize a **📬 message queue** (e.g., Redis Pub/Sub, RabbitMQ) to send notifications to users about upcoming events that match their preferences.
- Optional: **⏳ Include a delay** to send notifications closer to the event.

---

### 🧪 Unit Testing
- **🛠️ Unit tests** for core functionalities were written and tested using **Postman**, including:
  - **🔐 User authentication**
  - **📅 Event management**
  - **📍 Location-based search**
  - **🔔 Notification system**

---

## 🛠️ Additional Features

- **🌟 Event ratings and reviews**: Allow users to rate and review events.
- **🗺️ Mapping Integration**: Integrate with a **📍 mapping service** (e.g., Google Maps API) to display event locations on a map.
- **❤️ Favorite Events**: Enable users to save their favorite events for quick access.
- **⚡ Real-Time Updates**: Implement real-time updates for event changes.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Considerations

### 🗃️ Databases
- Choose a **💾 relational database** (e.g., PostgreSQL with PostGIS) to store user data, event data, and location information.

### 📦 Queuing System
- Use **🔄 Redis Pub/Sub** or **📬 RabbitMQ** to manage asynchronous notifications.

### ⚙️ Node.js Framework
- Utilize **⚡ Express.js** or a similar framework to structure your application.

### 🔐 Authentication
- Implement secure **🔑 password hashing** (e.g., bcrypt).
- Consider using **🛡️ Passport.js** for user authentication.

### 🌐 i18n Libraries
- Choose an **🌍 i18n library** (e.g., i18next) for internationalization.

### 🧪 Testing Framework
- **Postman** was used for unit testing.

### 🌍 Geospatial Libraries
- If using **Node.js** with **PostgreSQL** and **PostGIS**, utilize built-in **🌍 geospatial functions**.
